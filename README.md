# Navigation Mesh A-Frame Inspector Plugin

> WORK IN PROGRESS: This plugin is not yet stable or ready for use.

A plugin for the A-Frame Inspector, allowing creation of a navigation mesh while from an existing A-Frame scene. This plugin should not be used at runtime, in the final scene â€” instead:

1. Create your scene
2. Use this plugin to create and test a navigation mesh
3. Export the navigation mesh as a glTF or JSON file
4. Load the final navigation mesh into your scene as a normal model

## Introduction

A navigation mesh helps AI agents navigate, and is one way of constraining first-person controls and VR teleportation within a playable area. For information about using a navigation mesh in A-Frame, see [Pathfinding documentation in A-Frame Extras](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/tree/master/src/pathfinding).

## Installation

1. Add this script to an existing scene, installing the inspector plugin:

```html
<script src="https://recast-api.donmccurdy.com/aframe-inspector-plugin-recast.js"></script>
```

2. Add the plugin component to your scene:

```html
<a-scene inspector-plugin-recast> ...
```

3. Configure settings if needed, and press *Build*.

4. Close the inspector and test the navigation mesh, either using the [usual instructions](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/tree/master/src/pathfinding) or the included `nav-debug-pointer` component.

5. If things are working properly, use the *Export* button to save your finished navigation mesh as a `.gltf` file.

6. Load the navigation mesh into your finished scene with the [documentation in A-Frame Extras](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/tree/master/src/pathfinding).

## Debugging

This plugin includes an additional component for teleporting around a navigation mesh, `nav-debug-pointer`. It can be used alongside `movement-controls` to test out the navigation mesh with FPS-style movement. The cursor will display in green while looking at the navigation mesh, red while looking away, and allows teleporting to any part of the navigation mesh. The `movement-controls` component supports clamping player WASD movement within the mesh. AI pathfinding is described in [further documentation](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/tree/master/src/pathfinding).

```
<a-entity id="rig" movement-controls="constrainToNavMesh: true">
  <a-entity camera
            position="0 1.6 0"
            look-controls>
    <a-cursor nav-debug-pointer raycaster="objects: [nav-mesh];"></a-cursor>
  </a-entity>
</a-entity>
```
